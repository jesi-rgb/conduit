this is a sveltekit 5 with runes, tailwindcss 4 and daisyui 5 app, using iconify
and solar icons, and bits-ui components.

it's a chat app connected to openrouter. you bring your own 
key and start chatting with tons of models from open router


the main feature is that you can highlight parts of the
chat in order to create a branch, which opens a new
related but separate conversation on the side so the
context of the main app is clean. you can go on tangents
and clarify terms you don't know without polluting the
main conversation's context
